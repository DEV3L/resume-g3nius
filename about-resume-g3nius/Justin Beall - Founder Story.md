Behind every great innovation is a story of transformation. For Justin Beall, the founder of Resume G3nius, the seeds of innovation were planted in a career defined by adaptability, service, and relentless pursuit of excellence.

Justin’s professional journey began far from the world of resumes and career-building tools—on the battlefield. As a combat medic, he honed the ability to respond decisively under pressure, solve problems creatively, and serve others with unwavering commitment. These formative experiences instilled a deep appreciation for human potential and resilience, qualities that later became the bedrock of Resume G3nius.

### **The Birth of Resume G3nius**

In mid-2024, Justin recognized a glaring gap in the career services industry.

Most services lacked personalization, creativity, or meaningful insights into the evolving demands of industries. Justin saw an opportunity to combine his expertise in technology, strategy, and storytelling to create something revolutionary.

With just an idea and a few bold experiments, Resume G3nius was born. Built on the foundation of AI-driven insights, creative storytelling, and Justin’s passion for helping others, the platform quickly evolved into a full-fledged service that transforms not just resumes, but careers.
